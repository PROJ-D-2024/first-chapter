**The Ideal MLOps Pipeline: Analysis of Solutions in Public Cloud Environments**

### **1. Introduction**

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has become a crucial component of modern artificial intelligence-driven businesses. It bridges the gap between machine learning model development and deployment, ensuring scalability, reproducibility, monitoring, and automation of the entire ML lifecycle. With the increasing complexity of ML models, organizations require robust and efficient pipelines to streamline experimentation, model training, deployment, and maintenance.

Public cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer a wide range of tools and services designed to facilitate the implementation of MLOps. These platforms provide scalable infrastructure, pre-configured machine learning environments, automated model retraining, and integration with DevOps practices. However, selecting the most suitable pipeline architecture for a given use case is a challenging task due to the variety of available solutions and their associated trade-offs.

This study aims to analyze the key components of an ideal MLOps pipeline and compare existing solutions offered by public cloud providers. By identifying best practices, common challenges, and optimization strategies, this research provides insights into designing scalable and efficient MLOps pipelines.

### **2. Research Objectives**

The primary objective of this study is to analyze the architecture, implementation, and efficiency of MLOps pipelines in public cloud environments. Specifically, the study focuses on:

- Identifying essential components of an ideal MLOps pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, deployment, monitoring, and automation.
- Comparing and evaluating cloud-based MLOps solutions provided by AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
- Assessing the advantages and limitations of different architectures and toolchains for MLOps implementation.
- Identifying best practices for optimizing the efficiency, cost, and security of MLOps pipelines.

By conducting this analysis, the study aims to provide actionable insights for organizations seeking to implement or improve their MLOps workflows.

### **3. Scope of the Study**

This study focuses on MLOps pipelines implemented in public cloud environments, specifically analyzing solutions provided by:

- **AWS** – SageMaker, Step Functions, Lambda, and CI/CD integration.
- **Google Cloud** – Vertex AI, Kubeflow Pipelines, Cloud Functions, and AI Platform.
- **Microsoft Azure** – Azure ML, Azure Pipelines, and AutoML solutions.

The research will cover key MLOps lifecycle stages, including:
- **Data Management** – data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
- **Model Development** – experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and reproducibility.
- **Model Deployment** – containerization, serving infrastructure, and API exposure.
- **Monitoring and Governance** – model drift detection, logging, explainability, and compliance.

The study will not focus on purely on-premises or hybrid cloud solutions, nor will it cover general DevOps practices outside the ML domain.

### **4. Research Methodology**

The study will be conducted using the following research methods:

- **Literature Review** – an analysis of existing research, documentation, and case studies related to MLOps pipelines and cloud-based ML workflows.
- **Comparative Analysis** – a detailed comparison of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure MLOps solutions in terms of scalability, cost, automation, and ease of integration.
- **Experimental Evaluation** – implementation of sample ML workflows on different cloud platforms to evaluate real-world performance and usability.
- **Performance Metrics Assessment** – analysis of model training times, deployment latency, resource utilization, and cost efficiency.

### **Conclusion**

The first chapter introduces the topic of MLOps pipelines, highlighting their significance in automating and optimizing ML workflows. It defines the research objectives, outlines the study’s scope, and presents the methodology for evaluating cloud-based MLOps solutions. The subsequent chapters will provide a comprehensive examination of MLOps architectures, best practices, and the comparative efficiency of public cloud platforms in managing end-to-end machine learning operations.

By identifying the key factors influencing MLOps pipeline performance, this research aims to provide guidance for organizations aiming to enhance their ML workflows while ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and cost efficiency.
