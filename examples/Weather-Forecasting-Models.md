**Weather Forecasting Models**

### **1. Introduction**
Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in many aspects of daily life, from travel planning and outdoor event organization to managing critical infrastructure and responding to extreme weather phenomena. Accurate weather prediction is essential for agriculture, aviation, maritime transport, energy management, and crisis response systems.

Thanks to technological advancements, increased computing power, and the growing availability of satellite and meteorological data, modern weather forecasting models are becoming increasingly accurate. Contemporary methods include numerical, statistical, and artificial intelligence-based models, which enable the analysis of vast data sets and the improvement of forecast accuracy. This study aims to provide a detailed overview and comparison of different weather forecasting methods, their applications, and their effectiveness in various meteorological conditions.

The objective of this study is to analyze and compare various weather forecasting models in terms of their effectiveness, accuracy, and practical applications. Specifically, the study focuses on:
- Identifying the fundamental mechanisms of numerical, statistical, and AI-based models.
- Comparing the accuracy of selected methods in short-term and long-term forecasting.
- Discussing the limitations of existing models and possibilities for further development.

Through this analysis, it will be possible to identify the most effective forecasting techniques and determine their potential applications in different industries and everyday life.

### **3. Scope of the Study**
The scope of this study includes a detailed analysis of three main categories of weather forecasting models:
- **Numerical models** – utilizing physical equations describing atmospheric dynamics. This will include models such as GFS (Global Forecast System), ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), and WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model).
- **Statistical methods** – based on historical weather data analysis and the identification of atmospheric pattern changes. This study will focus on linear regression, time series analysis, and probabilistic algorithms.
- **Artificial intelligence algorithms** – including machine learning and neural networks used for weather prediction. The study will analyze deep learning models and hybrid approaches that combine meteorological data with satellite image analysis.

The study will not cover historical aspects of meteorology, specific methods of atmospheric data collection, or detailed physics of the atmosphere beyond their direct application in forecasting models.

### **4. Research Methodology**
The analysis will be conducted based on:
- **Literature review** – an analysis of existing research on weather forecasting methods, the effectiveness of specific models, and their practical applications.
- **Experimental comparison of forecast results** – a comparison of forecasts generated by different models with actual meteorological data.
- **Accuracy assessment of models** – using statistical measures such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination (R²), and errors in long-term and short-term forecasts.
- **Application analysis** – discussing cases where specific models perform best, e.g., in forecasting precipitation, temperature, storms, or climatic anomalies.
